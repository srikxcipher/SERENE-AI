## üõ†Ô∏è How We Address Key Problems

### Problem 1: **Personalized Recommendations Are Hard to Implement**
   **Solution**: We've trained and integrated machine learning models that dynamically adjust recommendations based on individual user inputs. By using decision trees for habit recommendations and clustering techniques for time management, we ensure each recommendation is tailored to the user's specific lifestyle.

### Problem 2: **Lack of Emotional Connection in Wellness Apps**
   **Solution**: Our chatbot analyzes the sentiment of user input in real-time and offers a supportive response. This ensures that users feel heard, validated, and encouraged, creating an emotional connection with the app.

### Problem 3: **Difficulty in Selecting Music Based on Mood**
   **Solution**: The app integrates a music recommendation engine that uses mood as the primary input. This ensures users always have the perfect soundtrack for any emotional state.
